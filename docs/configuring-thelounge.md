# Setting up The Lounge

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs [The Lounge](https://thelounge.com/) to run as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container wrapped in a systemd service.

The Lounge is a free and open-source collaborative wiki and documentation software, designed for seamless real-time collaboration. It can be used to manage a wiki, a knowledge base, project documentation, etc. It has various functions such as granular permissions management system, page history to track changes of articles, etc. It also supports diagramming tools like Draw.io, Excalidraw and Mermaid.

See the project's [documentation](https://thelounge.com/docs/) to learn what The Lounge does and why it might be useful to you.

## Prerequisites

To run a The Lounge instance it is necessary to prepare a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server and [Redis](https://redis.io/) server for managing a metadata database.

If you are looking for Ansible roles for them, you can check out [ansible-role-postgres](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-postgres) and [ansible-role-redis](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-redis), both of which are maintained by the [Mother-of-All-Self-Hosting (MASH)](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting) team. The roles for [KeyDB](https://keydb.dev/) ([ansible-role-keydb](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-keydb)) and [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) ([ansible-role-valkey](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-valkey)) are available as well.

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable The Lounge with this role, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file.

**Note**: the path should be something like `inventory/host_vars/mash.example.com/vars.yml` if you use the [MASH Ansible playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook).

```yaml
########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# thelounge                                                            #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################

thelounge_enabled: true

########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# /thelounge                                                           #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################
```

### Set the hostname

To enable the The Lounge instance you need to set the hostname as well. To do so, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file. Make sure to replace `example.com` with your own value.

```yaml
thelounge_hostname: "example.com"
```

After adjusting the hostname, make sure to adjust your DNS records to point the domain to your server.

**Note**: hosting The Lounge under a subpath (by configuring the `thelounge_path_prefix` variable) does not seem to be possible due to The Lounge's technical limitations.

### Extending the configuration

There are some additional things you may wish to configure about the component.

Take a look at:

- [`defaults/main.yml`](../defaults/main.yml) for some variables that you can customize via your `vars.yml` file. You can override settings (even those that don't have dedicated playbook variables) using the `thelounge_environment_variables_additional_variables` variable

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run the installation command of your playbook as below:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,start
```

If you use the MASH playbook, the shortcut commands with the [`just` program](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/just.md) are also available: `just install-all` or `just setup-all`

## Usage

After running the command for installation, The Lounge becomes available at the specified hostname like `https://example.com`.

To get started, open the URL on a web browser and create a first workspace by inputting required information. For an email address, make sure to input your own email address, not the one specified to `thelounge_environment_variable_mail_from_address`.

## Troubleshooting

### Check the service's logs

You can find the logs in [systemd-journald](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-journald.service.html) by logging in to the server with SSH and running `journalctl -fu thelounge` (or how you/your playbook named the service, e.g. `mash-thelounge`).
